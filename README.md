# WoW Token Price Predictor

A Python-based tool to **predict the in-game gold price of the WoW Token** in World of Warcraft using historical data and simple machine-learning/statistical approaches.

---

## Why this project

- The WoW Token allows players to exchange real money for gold (or gold for game time). The exchange rate fluctuates with in-game supply & demand, expansions, events, etc.  
- Knowing when the token is “cheap” (in gold) can help players decide whether to buy it or wait.  
- This project builds a model to **forecast future Token prices in gold**, enabling better decision-making for gold-rich or gold-poor players.
